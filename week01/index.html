    <h3><p>Throughout my 2 years working experience, I have contributed to positive customer satisfaction through critical thinking, and strong communication skill.  My strengths and qualifications are an ideal match to the Japanese Speaker requirements and will bring immediate value to your company.</p>
      
     <p> In my Japanese Speaking Customer Service Representative role, I exercise excellent communication skill, fast problem-solving, and satisfactory customer service abilities within my probation period. 
       <br/>While I am independently motivated, I appreciate collective efforts and collaborate productively within group settings. Moreover, I am competent in analytical skill and willingness to learn with proficiency in JLPT N2.</p>
  <p>I graduated from Tunku Abdul Rahman University college in the year 2017. My major is Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Food Science. I joined Japanese Language Society when I was in my University.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>Tay Ye Yong</p>
